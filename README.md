# CalcLang
CalcLang is an interpreted language designed to be used in a Math class. 
Oroginally it was created as a reply with scala however i switched it over to haskell for performance reasons.

#Haskell
-- In this version of CalcLang the lexer and the Parser are generated with Parsec

--The main difference with this version is that defining function syntax is slightly different.
--Scala -> it is f(x) = expr
--Haskell -> it is func f(x) = expr

The reason I did this was because the parser generator said their was an imbiguity which was something I was able to get out when I wrote my own grammer.

Speaking of the grammar the grammar of CalcLang is below

Taken from haskell parser generator
